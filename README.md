Implementation of ping in rust. Not as good as the one with graphing

I built this to learn ICMP.  This project will involve learning 
how to both construct and interpret different types of ICMP requests.  
I aim to have full feature parity with the default ping, including all 
flags.

ICMP is confusing, like really confusing

To be honest, reading this RFC is a nightmare. 
I'm not sure I'll be able to construct the packets, but hey, 
how do you get better at something if you don't try?

TEMPORARILY ON HOLD
